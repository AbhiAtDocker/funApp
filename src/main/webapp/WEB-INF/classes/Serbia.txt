definitions=a republic in the Balkans; population 7,200,000 (estimated 2015); official language, Serbian; capital, Belgrade..
notes=Serbia was conquered by the Turks in the 14th century, regaining independence in 1878. Serbian rivalry with the Austro-Hungarian Empire contributed to the outbreak of the First World War, after which Serbia was absorbed into the kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (named Yugoslavia from 1929–2003). In 1991–2 four out of the six Yugoslav republics seceded; Serbia became involved in armed conflict with neighbouring Croatia, the civil war in Bosnia, and the suppression of Albanian nationalism in Kosovo. On the break-up of Yugoslavia it remained in federation with Montenegro until 2006.
