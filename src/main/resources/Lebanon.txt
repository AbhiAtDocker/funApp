notes=Part of the Ottoman Empire from the early 16th century, Lebanon became a French mandate after the First World War and achieved independence in 1943. Until the mid 1970s the country prospered, but conflict between the Christian and Muslim communities, the influx of Palestinian refugees, and repeated Middle Eastern wars chronically destabilized the country. The first general elections for twenty years were held in 1992.
