definitions=a country in the north-western part of South America, having a coastline on both the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean; population 48,300,000 (estimated 2015); official language, Spanish; capital, Bogotá..
notes=Colombia was conquered by the Spanish in the early 16th century and achieved independence in the early 19th century, although the resulting Republic of Great Colombia lasted only until 1830, when first Venezuela and then Ecuador broke away to become independent states in their own right. The civil war of 1949–53 left the country struggling with poverty and social problems. During the 1990s guerrilla warfare involving government forces and rebel groups, partly funded by the drugs trade, dominated Colombia's countryside, but in the early 21st century progress was made towards restoring peace.Note that the spelling of the country is Colombia rather than Columbia, which is the name of a river in NW North America and a film production company and is also part of other proper names such as British Columbia and District of Columbia.
