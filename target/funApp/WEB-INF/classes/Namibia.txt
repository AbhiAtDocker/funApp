In 1920 it was mandated to South Africa by the League of Nations, becoming known as South West Africa. Despite international pressure South Africa continued to administer the country after the ending of the UN mandate in 1964, agreeing to withdraw only after several years of fighting by SWAPO guerrillas. Namibia became fully independent in 1990.
