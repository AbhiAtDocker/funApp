definitions=a country in the Balkans, formerly a constituent republic of Yugoslavia; population 3,800,000 (estimated 2015); capital, Sarajevo..
notes=Bosnia and Herzegovina were conquered by the Turks in 1463. The province of Bosnia and Herzegovina was annexed by Austria in 1908, an event which contributed towards the outbreak of the First World War. In 1918 it became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which changed its name to Yugoslavia in 1929. In 1992 Bosnia and Herzegovina followed Slovenia and Croatia in declaring independence, but ethnic conflict among Muslims, Serbs, and Croats quickly reduced the republic to a state of civil war. An accord signed in December 1995 formally brought the conflict to an end.
