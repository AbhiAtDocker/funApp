  A change that can't reveal itself
  will sweep through the earth
  for all the the bright reasons;
  reasons that won't have roots
  in the impractical (u call it practical) world, 
  though will influence the language,
  will push the horizon closer
  may be so close that dividing 
  line between sky and earth disappears;
  the freedom that humanity is meant to live
  as humans and not as time bound machines
  constrained by conditons like bird in cage;
  it has become their comfort zone. Change
  is casting its spell from behind the wall; 
  it will shatter it all...
